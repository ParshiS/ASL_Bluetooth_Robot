# ASL_Bluetooth_Robot
ASL gesture detection system using Neural Networks that uses Bluetooth to transmit commands to robot.

The American Sign Language system is the most prolific system of communication used by the
differently-abled people. We built a gesture detection system using Raspberry-pi, Neural
Compute Stick and WebCam, that utilizes existing Neural Network libraries to identify ASL. Additionally, a
bluetooth interface that connects to a mobile robot is developed. ASL commands to the robot
are processed as inputs for motion control of the Robot.
